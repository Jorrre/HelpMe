## Requirements

- Python
- Pip

## Installation

### Server

The Server has code that requires some dependencies. To install these, run the following:

- `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### RPI

The RPI folder contains code that requires the SenseHat dependency, which is easily install on an RPI but not elsewhere. We therefore recommend running the RPI code on an actual Raspberry Pi.

## Running the WebApps

The webapps are made out of pure HTML, CSS and JS (no framework) and can be viewed by opening the files in a browser or through Live Server etc.
